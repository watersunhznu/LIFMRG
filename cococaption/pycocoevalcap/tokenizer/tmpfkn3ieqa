top-normal heart size is unchanged compared to prior exams dating back to. there is mild perihilar fullness slightly improved compared to the prior exam. small bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left are persistent. coronary calcifications or stent are identified. scarring projecting over the mid left lung is persistent. mild bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged. right-sided picc line appears to terminate in the mid svc. there is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
there is now a right ij central venous catheter with tip projecting over the lower svc. remainder of the exam is unchanged noting bilateral parenchymal opacities. there is no pneumothorax.
the examination is somewhat limited by low lung volumes. redemonstrated are moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions. as compared to the prior examination there has been resolution of the pulmonary edema. no focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. the heart size is not well assessed but appears to be at least mildly enlarged. mediastinal contours are stable.
right-sided chest tube has been removed. there is a hydropneumothorax in the inferior right chest. the amount of fluid has increased compared to the study from two days prior. the <unk> irregular pleural disease around the right lung is again visualized. the left lung is clear. cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.
vague opacity projecting over the right midlower lung the which is new since prior. elsewhere the lungs are clear. there is no layering effusion. cardiac silhouette is enlarged but similar in configuration. multiple vascular <unk> are again noted projecting over the svc left brachiocephalic vein and left upper <unk>. surgical clips project over the lower neck. no acute osseous abnormalities.
frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate minimal blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles. there is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. the heart size is moderately enlarged and there are post-surgical changes of median sternotomy and cabg. there is an indistinct appearance of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
single portable view of the chest. low lung volumes are again noted. chronic changes compatible with patients pulmonary <unk> are noted. more severely <unk> areas seen at the bases left greater than right. cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. no acute osseous abnormalities identified.
